 * 
 * Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the 
 * maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] 
 * and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. 
 * Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, 
 * find out the maximum value subset of val[] 
 * such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. 
 * You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
